# Reflection by Aaron Altmeyer

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`.  This file created
multiple lines of output that did various manipulations: insert, delete and
change.  In order to do this, I used the random class to create random integers
and random characters for these manipulations.  This program is interesting and
challenging at the same time.  I haven't struggled this much with a lab.  I
think the most difficult aspect of creating this program is understanding what
it is you need to code.  Replacing letters was simple, but when we started
using substrings it got a bit confusing.  Once I figured out how to properly do
the substrings for my deletions and insertions it became rather simple.  I
finished step five quickly after struggling with steps three and four.

Overall, I think this is the most interesting program that we have made, partly
because I am a biology major and I have heard about bioinformatics before.  It
is definitely a course that I would be interested in taking in the future.
